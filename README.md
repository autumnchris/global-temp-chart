# Global Temperature Chart

A D3.js heat map built in React.js that presents the monthly variance of the global temperature from the years 1753 to 2015.

Inspired by the [Visualize Data with a Heat Map challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map) as part of the curriculum for the [Data Visualization Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
